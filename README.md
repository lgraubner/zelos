# Zelos

> âš¡ A batteries included static site generator for Node.js

## Installation

Either install as global package or dependency of your project.

```bash
npm install -D zelos
```

## Motivation

There are a lot of awesome generators out there such as [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and many more. You might ask why another static site generator.

..
This package aims for a zero config experience to quickly create static websites. In contrast to the bundler ecosystem (Webpack, Parcel, et al.) most static site generators written for Node.js are heading to a plugin based architecture. This makes them very flexible but require some decent amount of time to configure in the first place.
